(“we,” “us,” “our” and \"**Upstart**\"), to (i) request loan offers from Upstart and/or financial institutions and licensed lenders we have partnered with (each a \"Creditor\"), and (ii) apply for and, if approved, obtain a loan from a Creditor who provides you with an offer. The Upstart platform includes its website, www.upstart.com and any subdomains and mobile application (the \"**Website**\"), and certain products and services you access through or in connection with the Website.  Upstart acts as the Creditor’s agent and provides services to the Creditor and its successors and assigns, in connection with your loan application, your loan origination, and the servicing of your loan on the Website.\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003eThis is an important document. You must read it carefully and accept all of its terms and conditions before choosing to proceed. You should save/print a copy of these Terms for your records. By clicking \"I agree\" you are electronically agreeing to these Terms. NOTE, THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALL CLAIMS (see Section 15).\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n1. **Loan Offers.** By submitting information to us on the Website, you are requesting loan offers from the Creditor. Upstart is not an agent of you when you request a loan offer from the Creditor. Any loan offer request you submit is not an application for credit, rather it is a request to receive a conditional loan offer. Loan offers are made to eligible individuals who satisfy the Creditor’s credit policy. You understand you must meet certain basic credit criteria established by the Creditor in order to be eligible to receive a loan. Neither we nor the Creditor can guarantee that you will be presented with loan offer(s) or that you will meet the approval criteria for any particular offer. In order to proceed with a loan offer you must submit a loan application to the Creditor via the Website. It is always your choice whether to apply for a loan and we will never submit an application on your behalf without your consent. The Creditor may withdraw a loan offer, terminate consideration of any application you submit, or withdraw approval of your loan at any time in its sole discretion. If for any reason you do not qualify, or you later cease to qualify, for a loan offered to you, (if, for example, your credit score from any consumer reporting agency falls significantly or your debt to income ratio changes), the Creditor may withdraw its approval of your loan.\r\n\r\n2. **Credit Report.** You have authorized us on behalf of the Creditor to obtain your credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies. If we obtained information from a consumer reporting agency in connection with the Creditor’s consideration of your loan application, its name, address and toll-free telephone number are as follows: Equifax, P.O. Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374-0256, (866) 349-5191; and TransUnion, P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, (800) 916-8800. You have a right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to know the information contained in your credit file at the consumer reporting agency. You also have a right to a free copy of your report from the reporting agency, if you request it no later than 60 days after your information has been obtained by Upstart. If you find that any information contained in the report you receive is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to dispute the inaccuracy with the reporting agency. Please note, the reporting agency plays no part in any lending decision and, if you were declined, will be unable to supply specific reasons why you didn’t receive a loan offer.\r\n\r\n3. **Loan Application, Verification, and Loan Closing.**\r\n\r\n   a. To receive a loan, you must select a loan offer from the Creditor and, after proceeding, submit a loan application through the Website. You authorize us, as an agent of and on behalf of the Creditor, to verify any information you provided when you requested a loan offer, including information about your education, employment and your annual income, as well as additional information you submit after choosing to proceed with your loan offer, and to confirm your loan payoff amount if you are applying for an automobile refinance product, by calling you, requiring you to produce appropriate documentation or other proof, and/or to conduct such verification through a third party. For an automobile-secured loan offer, you agree that Upstart and Auto Data Direct, Inc. may obtain from the applicable state agencies or departments, the ownership records for your automobile including the addresses and names of all owners and lienholders. You also authorize us, on behalf of the Creditor, to request and obtain data from a third party to verify any information that you provide in connection with your loan application. Your completed loan application must be approved by the Creditor. After approval, you will be presented your final loan terms and related Truth-in-Lending disclosures, which you must accept in order to qualify for the loan, by digitally signing your promissory note (the “**Note**”) within the time periods disclosed to you in the loan application flow. \r\n\r\n If your loan application is approved then, subject to clause (b) below, your loan, as evidenced by the Note you made to the Creditor, will be submitted to the Creditor for origination.  Your loan will be on the terms set forth in the Note. \r\n\r\n   b. The Creditor may withdraw its approval of your loan application at any time prior to origination: (i) in the event of any inaccuracy or omission in your loan application; (ii) if you committed fraud or made a misrepresentation in connection with your application; or (iii) any other disqualifying event occurs. The Creditor may withdraw its approval of your loan even after you have signed your Note. In the event that your loan application is declined or withdrawn, we will retain a record of your loan application for a period of at least 25 months in accordance with federal law.\r\n\r\n c. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.   As a result, under our customer identification program, we must ask for your name, street address, mailing address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you.\r\n\r\n4. \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePlaid Account Verification Terms.\u003c/b\u003e With your consent, Upstart, its affiliates, assigns, agents, contractors, service providers, and Creditors (collectively “we”, “us”, and “our”) may use Plaid Inc. (f/k/a Plaid Technologies, Inc.) to gather certain personal and financial account data from your financial institution. You agree to share your account data with us to confirm your account information, identity, income, and/or debt obligations, to allow us to provide better customer support during your relationship with us, and to improve our products and services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nBy using the Plaid services, you give Plaid the authority to transmit your account data, including transaction history, from your financial institution to us. You agree to allow Plaid to transfer, store, and process your account data in accordance with the \u003ca href=\"https://plaid.com/legal\"\u003ePlaid Privacy Policy\u003c/a\u003e, which states that Plaid may access and retain this data on a continuous basis even after you no longer have a relationship with Upstart or one of our Creditors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf you would like to opt out of these Plaid services, please email Upstart at privacy@upstart.com or email Plaid at privacy@plaid.com or visit the \u003ca href=\"https://my.plaid.com/\"\u003ePlaid Portal\u003c/a\u003e. Opting out with Upstart stops our use of Plaid services and may not terminate Plaid’s access to your account data; you should contact Plaid directly if you wish to opt out of all Plaid services. We are not acting as an agent of your financial institution. You must agree to all of these Terms in order to use the Plaid services.\r\n\r\n5. **Fees.** Upstart does not charge you any fee for its services. Upstart is paid fees by the Creditor in the event your loan application results in an originated loan. \r\n \r\n \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Creditor may charge you fees if your loan application results in an originated loan. For example, you may be required to pay the Creditor \u003cu\u003ea non-refundable origination fee\u003c/u\u003e. The amount of the fee and how it must be paid will be stated in the disclosures and the Note provided to you. If you receive an unsecured personal loan from the Creditor, This fee will be deducted from your loan proceeds, so the loan proceeds delivered to you will be less than the full amount of your issued loan.  If you receive an automobile refinance loan, this fee will be added to the payoff amount of your existing loan.  You acknowledge that the origination fee will be considered part of the principal on your loan subject to the accrual of interest.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n \r\n Additional fees, such as late fees and ACH or check return fees, may also apply to your loan. These fees will be disclosed in your Truth-in-Lending disclosure and your Note. \r\n\r\n6. **Loan Servicing.** If your loan application results in an originated loan, you acknowledge and agree that we may serve as the loan servicer on behalf of the Creditor and its successors and assigns. As loan servicer, we will administer your loan, and may collect on your loan, on behalf of the Creditor and any of its successors and assigns. If we are servicing your loan, a copy of your Note(s) representing your loan(s) will be maintained in electronic form on the Website and made available to you for review on the Website, subject to site availability. You will also be able to manage your loan repayments via the Website. \r\n\r\n7. **Other Products and Services.** Any products and services you use through the Website shall be governed by these Terms and any additional terms and conditions you agree to when signing up for a particular product or service.

The Arbitrator (defined below) shall apply applicable law and applicable statutes of limitation consistent with the FAA and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.\r\n\r\n   B. *Dispute*: Dispute” means any action, dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind arising out of, in connection with or in any way related, even indirectly, to this Agreement or your use of the Website, including the products and services you accessed via the Website, or the loan you received from Creditor on the Website.  For example, “Dispute” includes claims related to: any relationship resulting from, or activities connected to this Agreement; any loan application on the Website; information you have provided to us via the Website; information and disclosures provided to you on the Website; any other agreements between you and us; extensions; renewals; refinancings; payment plans; underwriting; servicing; collections; privacy; and customer information.  The term \"Dispute\" also includes: claims under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims in tort or contract; claims under statutes or common law; claims at law or in equity; other past, present or future claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, third party claims, interpleaders or otherwise; and any claim relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this arbitration clause, including, any claim that all or any part of this arbitration clause, except paragraph G below, is void, voidable or unconscionable.\r\n\r\n   C. *Mandatory Arbitration*: Unless otherwise stated in this arbitration clause, any \"Dispute\" between you and us, including Creditor, shall, at the election of you, us, or our respective heirs, successors, assignees or related third parties and their affiliates, subsidiaries, and parents, (\"**the Parties**\"), be resolved by a neutral, binding arbitration, and not by a court of law. This procedure includes any Dispute over the interpretation, scope, or validity of this Agreement, this arbitration clause or the arbitrability of any issue, with the sole exception of the Parties' waiver of any right to bring a class action or to participate in a class action as provided for under paragraph G below shall be solely determined by the appropriate court, if necessary. This arbitration clause applies to the Parties, including their respective employees or agents, as to all matters which arise out of or relate to these Terms, your use of the Website, including the products and services accessed via the website,  or are in any way connected with the loan you received on the Website , or any resulting transaction or relationship.\r\n\r\n   D. *Facts About Arbitration*: In arbitration, a neutral third party (**“Arbitrator”**) resolves Disputes, instead of a judge or jury.  You, with us, waive the right to go to court. The Arbitrator will conduct a hearing, which is private and less formal than a court trial. Each side will have the opportunity to present some evidence to the Arbitrator.  The Arbitrator may limit the Parties’ ability to conduct fact-finding prior to the hearing, called “discovery.”  Other rights that the Parties might have in court might not be available in arbitration.  Following the hearing, the Arbitrator will issue an award.  The Arbitrator’s decision is final, and a court may then enforce the award like a court judgment.  Courts rarely overturn an Arbitrator’s award.\r\n\r\n   E. *Pre-Arbitration Resolution*: Prior to starting arbitration, you can call us at (650) 204-1000 or write to us at Upstart Loan Operations, P.O. Box 1503, San Carlos, CA 94070 to attempt to resolve the Dispute. We will try to resolve the Dispute. If we make a written offer (**“Settlement Offer”**), you may reject it and arbitrate. If we do not resolve the Dispute, either party may start arbitration. No party will disclose settlement proposals, including a Settlement Offer, to the Arbitrator.\r\n\r\n F. *Rules and Procedures*: Either party may start arbitration by mailing a notice of arbitration, even if a lawsuit has been filed. Such notice shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested. Notice to me shall be sent to the email address I provided to you in your loan application, as updated. Notice to us, the Creditor and its assignees or related third parties shall be sent to Upstart Loan Operations, P.O. Box 1503, San Carlos, CA 94070. The Party initiating the arbitration shall set forth in the notice the nature and factual basis of the Dispute, the names and addresses of all other Parties, the amount involved, and the specific relief requested. The responding Party must mail a response within 45 days, and may also set forth any counter-Disputes. The American Arbitration Association (**“AAA”**) shall conduct any arbitration according to this arbitration clause. The AAA arbitration rules in effect when the claim is filed apply (**“AAA Rules”**), except where those rules conflict with this Arbitration Clause or any of our agreements with you. You can get copies of the AAA Rules at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) or by calling 800-778-7879. You or we may choose to have a hearing, appear at any hearing by phone or other electronic means, and/or be represented by counsel.\r\n\r\n   G. *Class Action Waiver*: The Parties agree to give up any right they may have to bring a class action lawsuit or class arbitration, or to participate in either as a claimant. The Parties agree to give up any right to consolidate or join any arbitration proceeding with the arbitration of others. The Parties give up the right to serve as a private attorney general in any jurisdiction in which such procedure might be permitted. To the extent the Parties are permitted to file small claims under Paragraph K below, the Parties agree that any small claim may only be brought on an individual basis and that no small claim may be brought on a class or representative basis. The Parties further agree that if a court or arbitrator decides this Paragraph G is void or unenforceable, this arbitration clause shall be void and without effect.\r\n\r\n  H. *Fees and Costs*: If you request, we shall advance all of the Arbitrator’s fees and expenses, as well as all administrative and filing fees, up to an amount of $1000. The Parties shall be responsible for their own attorneys’ fees associated with any arbitration, unless otherwise allowed for under applicable substantive law and awarded by the Arbitrator. If the Arbitrator awards you funds, we will not have to reimburse any arbitration fees and expenses we have advanced. If the Arbitrator does not award you funds, you agree to reimburse us for any arbitration fees and expenses we have advanced. Any such reimbursement shall not exceed the filings fees and costs you would have incurred had you filed a lawsuit in court.\r\n\r\n   I. *Exceptions*: The Parties agree that this arbitration clause is not applicable to \"small claims\" meaning those claims that either Party is entitled to file and maintain in an appropriate small claims court or any action where the total amount in controversy is no greater than $10,000, including any claims for attorney's fees and non-monetary relief.  The Parties agree that any small claim may only be brought on an individual basis and that no small claim may be brought on a class or representative basis. The Parties agree that any appeal from a judgment obtained pursuant to this paragraph shall be appealable only by arbitration according to the procedures set forth in this arbitration clause.\r\n\r\n J. *Severability*: If it is determined that any paragraph or provision in this arbitration clause is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the other paragraphs and provisions of this arbitration clause. The remainder of this arbitration clause shall continue in full force and effect as if the severed paragraph or provision had not been included. Notwithstanding this severability provision, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines paragraph G to be void, illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the Parties agree that paragraph G above shall not be severed and that this arbitration clause shall be void in its entirety.\r\n\r\n   K. *Right to Opt Out*. If you do not want this arbitration clause to apply, you may reject it by mailing a written notice to us that lists your name, address and account/loan number and states that you are opting out of the arbitration clause. An opt out notice is only effective if it is signed by you, and the envelope that the opt out notice is sent in is postmarked no more than 30 calendar days after the date you agreed to the Terms. If you opt out of this arbitration clause, it will not affect any other provisions of these Terms or your   obligations under any other agreement with us. If you do not properly opt out as set forth above, it will be effective as of the date you agreed to these Terms.  If you opt out of this arbitration clause, such election shall apply only to these Terms, and not to any other past, present or future agreements you have with us.\r\n\r\n**FOR ALL DISPUTES COVERED BY THIS PROVISION, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, THEIR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS, AND THEIR RIGHT TO SEEK PUNITIVE AND/OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES AND CLAIMS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISION, ARBITRATION SHALL BE IN PLACE OF ANY CIVIL LITIGATION IN ANY COURT AND IN PLACE OF ANY TRIAL BY JURY.**\r\n\r\n**THE TERMS OF THIS PROVISION AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANY TERMS OF THIS PROVISION OR THE COST, ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES OF ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND YOU SHOULD SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE BEFORE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY EACH OF THE PROVISIONS, COVENANTS AND STIPULATIONS ABOVE.**\r\n\r\n\r\n16. **Amendments.**  We may amend these Terms and such amendments will become effective upon publication on the Website. We will provide you with at least 30 days written notice of any material changes.\r\n\r\n17. **Assignment.** You hereby agree that we may, without notice to you, assign all of our rights, title and interest in these Terms to a third party. To the extent provided therein, any such assignment will release us from all of our obligations and duties under these Terms and the assignee will be solely responsible for the performance of such obligations and duties. You may not assign, transfer, sublicense or otherwise delegate your rights or obligations under these Terms to another person without our prior written consent. Any such assignment, transfer, sublicense or delegation in violation of this Section 17 will be null and void.\r\n\r\n18. **Processing Errors.**  You agree that we, on behalf of the Creditor and any of its successors or assigns, may promptly correct any transaction processing error that is discovered. If the error results in your receipt of less than the correct amount to which you are entitled, you will be credited the difference. If the error results in your receipt of more than the correct amount to which you are entitled, you agree that we, on behalf of the Creditor, may debit the extra funds upon prior notice to you. You agree to provide any additional consents necessary to correct any errors that occur. \r\n\r\n19. **Miscellaneous.** These Terms, along with the Creditor Privacy Policy, the Website Terms of Use, and any other agreements you enter into with us on the Website in connection with your use of additional products or services, represent the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of these Terms and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, promises and proposals, whether oral, written or electronic, between us with respect to your use of the Website. These Terms are independent of any agreements you enter into with the Creditor in connection with any loan you receive on the Website. The Creditor is not a party to these Terms, but you agree that it, including its successors and assigns, is a third-party beneficiary and is entitled to rely on the provisions of these Terms, including your representations, covenants and agreements herein. There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms other than the Creditor. You acknowledge and agree that Upstart and the Creditor are separate legal entities and neither has guaranteed the performance of the respective obligations of any other entity than itself. Any waiver of a breach of a provision of these Terms will not be a waiver of any other subsequent breach. Failure or delay by either party to enforce any term or condition of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such term or condition. If at any time after the date of these Terms, any of the provisions of these Terms is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such provision will be of no force and effect, but the illegality and unenforceability of such provision will have no effect upon and will not impair the enforceability of any other provisions of these Terms. The headings in these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the interpretation of these Terms in any way.\r\n\r\nLast Updated: January 8, 2025\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n","disableTracking":false,"trackLegalConsentPath":"/legal_consents/track","substitutionVariables":{},"applicationUuid":"93efba33-1ade-40b3-9b93-515873473caf"}</script>
