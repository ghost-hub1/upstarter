Subject to any applicable legal exemptions including the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, and/or the Fair Credit Reporting Act,  we may disclose your personal information, including personally identifiable financial information with:\r\n-\tCreditors that you request a conditional loan offers from or who decline to pre-approve you for a loan when you request a loan offer;\r\n-\tUpstart companies, our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership;\r\n-\tService providers, vendors, contractors, and consultants who help with parts of our business operations such as fraud prevention, servicing, bill collection, debt collection, advertising, marketing and technology services, product development, and nonaffiliated financial institutions that we partner with to market or provide the products or services to you;\r\n-\tCredit reporting agencies to report account information, at your direction and otherwise as permitted by law;\r\n-\tDebt collection companies that purchase your loan from a Creditor if it has been charged off;\r\n-\tCompanies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by, or companies we plan to sell, divest or transfer all or a portion of our products and/or services to, including any back-up service provider or back-up administrator we, or any Creditor engage in the event we stop operating;\r\n-\tLaw enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when (1) we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, (2) we need to do so to comply with law, or (3) if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of your personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity; and\r\n-\tOther third parties but only if you consent or direct us to do so.\r\n\r\nIf you select a loan offer from one of our Marketplace Lenders, such as Cross River Bank,when you sign your promissory note, your loans may automatically be allocated to investors as follows:\r\n-\tInvestors may purchase your loan directly from us. We provide information about you included in your application, including personally identifiable, financial, and credit information, and your loan terms to these investors and their agents and trustees in advance of their purchase of your loan.\r\n-\tAs the servicer of your loan we will also share information we obtain in servicing your loan, including about your repayments, to Upstart Network Trust and these investors, who became the Creditor of your loan, any subsequent purchaser of your loan, and each of their agents or trustees.\r\nIf you have an income share agreement, we will share your name and information about your repayment history with investors in your income share agreement.\r\n\r\nPlease note, information that has been aggregated, anonymized or de-identified so that it does not identify a specific user is not considered personal information.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, federal and state laws allow you to restrict the disclosure of your personally identifiable financial information in certain instances such as disclosing your information so that third parties can market to you.\r\nUpstart collects consent to send SMS messages to customers. If you provide your consent for Upstart to send you messages, Upstart will not pass this consent to other parties. \r\n***\r\n#### How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technology to Collect Information\r\nWe engage others to provide analytics, serve advertisements, and perform related services across the web and in mobile apps. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and mobile apps, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in mobile apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information is used to deliver advertising targeted to your interests on other companies’ sites or mobile apps and to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your activity. Some of our advertising partners enable us to translate your email address or phone number into an identifier that can’t be used to identify you personally. Our advertising partners then use that unique identifier to show ads that are more relevant to you across the web and in mobile apps. Some of the activities described in this section may constitute “targeted advertising,” “sharing,” or “selling” under certain laws. To learn more about the choices available to you with respect to these practices, see below “Opting Out of Targeted Advertising, Sharing, and Sales”.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n#### How We Protect Your Information\r\n\r\n\r\nWe care about the security of your information and take reasonable measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.\r\nYou are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from us at all times. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.\r\nIn the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Links to or from Other Websites and Services\r\nWe are not responsible for the practices employed by any third party, or websites or services linked to or from the Site, including any information or content they contain. Please remember that when you use a link from a third party to visit our Site, or use a link to go from the Site to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link or advertisement on the Site, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies, including their terms and conditions and privacy practices. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and we do not control any third-parties that you authorize to access your user content. If you are using a third-party website or service (like LinkedIn) and you allow such a third-party access to your user content, you do so at your own risk.\r\n***\r\n#### How You Can Access or Change Your Personal Information\r\nYou can review and edit some of your personal information at any time by logging into the Site.\r\n***\r\n#### Account Profile\r\nYou can update certain account profile information by logging into your account. You may also choose to update your email address or username. Please note that any changes you make to your account profile must be in accordance with our Terms of Use.\r\n***\r\n#### Affiliate and Non-Affiliate Data Sharing\r\nIn compliance with applicable laws, Upstart collects personal information from other Upstart Affiliates. In certain cases, you have the right to opt out of this sharing if your loan originated through Upstart.com or Upstart mobile or you have a continuing relationship with Upstart. Review our Privacy Notice below to learn when this right applies. Visit Your Preferences Center to learn more. Please note, to streamline operations and ensure seamless financial experiences, Upstart affiliates may share services including account management, transaction processing, model use, including model training and development, and customer support. These shared services adhere to strict privacy and security standards, protecting customer information while enabling efficient service delivery.\r\nIf your loan does not originate through Upstart.com or Upstart mobile, but rather through Upstart’s online marketplace, we will not share your personal information. More specifically, because your loan does not originate through Upstart.com or Upstart mobile, there is not an option to opt-out of sharing. As such, please contact your lender directly regarding any personal information collected and your right to opt-out.\r\n\r\n***\r\n#### Children’s Privacy\r\nWe do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register as users. The Site and its content are not directed at children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information promptly. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@upstart.com.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS\r\nThis section applies to U.S. state privacy laws (like California’s CCPA) that apply to data we collect about you. Please note, however, that these broadly-applicable privacy laws do not apply to what is referred to as personally identifiable financial information collected by financial institutions (like Upstart), as that information is subject instead to other financial privacy laws (like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)). As a result, these laws do not apply to most of the information that Upstart collects. The details below only apply to the more limited personal information we collect that is subject to these broadly-applicable U.S. state privacy laws.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Access, Correction, and Deletion**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nDepending on where you reside, you may have the right under certain U.S. state privacy laws to (1) request to know more about and access your personal information, (2) request deletion of your personal information, and (3) request correction of inaccurate personal information. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo request access, correction, or deletion of personal information that is subject to these privacy laws, please go to https://www.upstart.com/datarequest or contact us privacy@upstart.com. If we deny your request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us at privacy@upstart.com. If you have concerns about the results of an appeal, you may contact the attorney general in the state where you reside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n**Opting Out of Targeted Advertising, Sharing, and Sales**\r\n\r\nAs described in the HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT INFORMATION section above, we process personal information to understand and improve your experience with our Services and to serve you advertisements on other properties. Some of these activities may be considered “sales” or “sharing” of your personal information or “targeted advertising” under the law that applies to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nDepending on where you reside, you may have the right to opt-out of targeted advertising, sharing, and sales of your personal information. You can do so by following the prompts here https://www.upstart.com/datarequest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n**Data Retention**\r\n\r\nDue to the regulated nature of our industry, we are under legal requirements to retain data and are generally not able to delete consumer transactional data, credit or deposit account application data, or other financial information upon request. Certain regulations issued by state and/or federal government agencies may require us to maintain and report demographic information on the collective activities of our customers. We may also be required to maintain information about you for at least seven years to comply with applicable federal and state laws regarding recordkeeping, reporting, and audits. Criteria used to determine the period of time information about you is retained are primarily related to legal requirements and usefulness of the information for the purposes it was collected. We store this personal information for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other business purposes explained in this Privacy Policy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n**Additional Information for California, Colorado, and Oregon Consumers**\r\n\r\nThis section provides additional details about the personal information we collect about California, Colorado, and Oregon consumers and the rights afforded to them under the  California Consumer Privacy Act (“**CCPA**”), the Colorado Privacy Act (“**CPA**”), and the Oregon Consume Privacy Act (**OCPA**).\r\nPlease see the chart below for a list of the personal information subject to the CCPA,CPA, and OCPA we have collected about California, Colorado, and/or Oregon consumers in the last 12 months, along with our business and commercial processing purposes and categories of third parties to whom this information may be disclosed.

We have no actual knowledge of “sharing” or “selling” information about children younger than 16. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo opt out, you can use our cookie preferences tool to disable ad trackers on our website and can adjust your mobile device settings to limit ad tracking via the mobile app. You can also opt out by visiting our Services with a recognized universal choice signal enabled (such as the Global Privacy Control). Please note that, depending on which opt-out preference signal you use, our processing of the signal may be limited to the specific browser or device that you are using. You may need to renew your opt-out if you use a different browser or device to access our Services. If we detect an automated opt out preference signal, we will treat it as a request to opt out of “sharing” and “selling” for the browser or device sending the signal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIn addition to those rights, California,  Colorado, and Oregon consumers have the rights described above under the Your Privacy Rights section above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYou may also designate an authorized agent to exercise privacy rights on your behalf by providing the authorized agent signed permission to submit the request on your behalf. If an authorized agent submits a request on your behalf, we may need to contact you to verify your identity and protect the security of your personal information. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a rights request, please contact us at privacy@upstart.com.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Changes to Our Privacy Policy\r\nWe may amend this policy from time to time to reflect the changes in our business and practices, and so you should review this page periodically.
